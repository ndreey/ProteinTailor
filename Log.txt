Created revTranslate() that reverse translates amino acid sequence to rna sequence with string and codon usage table dictionary.
Tested revTranslate() against https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/rev_trans.html and got the same output!

For the start the plan is to tailor for e_coli.
I therefore used the "average" codon usage table from https://www.genscript.com/tools/codon-frequency-table as standard codon usage table.
For the reason of comparing tailored vs raw.
As there was no download option i had to copy paste and edit. 
I only wanted the codons, aa and fraction. So i manually removed freq and number.
In the end i had this
  TTT
  TTC
  TTA
  TTG	
  F
  F
  L
  L	
  0.59
  0.41
  0.28
  0.29	
I then created a script (standardCUT.py) to create a dictionary in the same format as the python_codon_table package by Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry.
dict{aminoacid:{codon:fraction,codon2;fraction}}
I also added a standard codon usage table for yeast.
