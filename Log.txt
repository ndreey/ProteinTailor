Created revTranslate() that reverse translates amino acid sequence to rna sequence with string and codon usage table dictionary.
Tested revTranslate() against https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/rev_trans.html and got the same output!

For the start the plan is to tailor for e_coli.
I therefore used the "average" codon usage table from https://www.genscript.com/tools/codon-frequency-table as standard codon usage table.
For the reason of comparing tailored vs raw.
As there was no download option i had to copy paste and edit. 
I only wanted the codons, aa and fraction. So i manually removed freq and number.
In the end i had this
  TTT
  TTC
  TTA
  TTG	
  F
  F
  L
  L	
  0.59
  0.41
  0.28
  0.29	
I then created a script (standardCUT.py) to create a dictionary in the same format as the python_codon_table package by Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry.
dict{aminoacid:{codon:fraction,codon2;fraction}}
I also added a standard codon usage table for yeast.

Created transcribe() that transcribes cDNA to mRNA

Created uniprot_seq() that retrieves the amino acid sequence from Uniprot.org.
It extracts the sequence by requesting the fasta format as a string from uniprot's api.
With a Uniprot accession id one can thus access both SwissProt reviewd or unreviewd sequences.
If one wants the isoform, one must thus enter which isoform of the accession by writing the specific number.

Example: uniprot_seq("Q9JK66", isoform = 4)
It will thus compile accession with isoform to Q9JK66-4 then search through the record.id of the fasta.
sp|Q9JK66|PRKN_RAT
sp|Q9JK66-5|PRKN_RAT
sp|Q9JK66-6|PRKN_RAT
sp|Q9JK66-4|PRKN_RAT    # Match! Will therefore return this amino acid sequence.
sp|Q9JK66-3|PRKN_RAT

Updated on the revTranslate()
Instead of downloading CUT from e_coli strain we use the standard CUT's that i created 09-10-2022.
